He was not perceived as an independent leader. The leader on the Soviet line, that is, the chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the republic, was also not considered the head of state, even a sovereign one. The chairman of the Council of Ministers of the republic was a purely technical figure. Therefore, not only in Kazakhstan, but also in other Soviet republics, they decided to establish the presidency. This is actually still a part of the USSR, but already an independent political figure, in parallel with the party power. The same Nursultan Abishevich as the first secretary, he was a member of the CPSU, but as president he was already a representative of the people of Kazakhstan. This was already such an action, constitutional, which brought the head of the republic to an independent level. He was accountable to the people, not to the Central Committee of the party.</span></div></div></div>

"There was no money even for survival"<br>

<p></p>"We always had financial difficulties in the family. We didn't have our own housing. I dropped out of school due to lack of money, I was constantly looking for a part-time job. I had abilities in one industry, but either I was unlucky or something else, I didn’t finish a single business. ”It was hard without education.</p><br>

<p></p>In recent years, I faced fraud, because of the pandemic, the business had to say goodbye, there were several loans, because of which I was not officially hired. And when you work in black, you don't even have a license. If you are dissatisfied with something, you cannot declare it, the employer is holding tightly. Plus, I was depressed: everything seemed to be fine, and then suddenly everything became very bad, I was bankrupt. I took deferrals, received 42,500, but they were not enough. I was afraid everywhere that they might be deceived. There was no money left even for survival. "</p>
